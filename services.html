        <h2 id="methods-heading">Therapeutic methods</h2>
        <p>Michael works in a flexible and practical way, drawing on a small number of well established counselling approaches. Methods are chosen based on what feels most useful for the individual, rather than following a set formula.</p>
        <p>The work is guided by a person centred framework, which means sessions are shaped around the client's needs, pace, and priorities.</p>

          <h3 id="methods-detail-heading">Cognitive behavioural therapy</h3>
          <p>Cognitive behavioural therapy focuses on understanding how thoughts, emotions, and behaviours influence one another.</p>
          <p>In practice, this often involves noticing patterns that may be contributing to stress or feeling stuck, and exploring different ways of responding. The aim is to build practical skills that support clearer thinking and greater confidence in everyday situations.</p>
          <p>The focus is on what is happening now, and on changes that feel achievable.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Solution focused counselling</h3>
          <p>Solution focused counselling places emphasis on what the client wants to be different, rather than spending long periods analysing the problem.</p>
          <p>This approach helps identify strengths, resources, and times when things have felt even slightly better. From there, small and realistic steps are explored.</p>
          <p>It is often helpful for people who want a clear sense of direction or are feeling unsure about next steps.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Acceptance and commitment therapy</h3>
          <p>Acceptance and commitment therapy supports people to relate differently to difficult thoughts and feelings, rather than trying to get rid of them.</p>
          <p>The work encourages noticing what is happening internally, while also clarifying what matters most. From there, attention is given to actions that align with personal values, even when things feel uncomfortable.</p>
          <p>This approach can be helpful for people who feel caught in cycles of worry, avoidance, or self criticism.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Mindfulness based approaches</h3>
          <p>Mindfulness based approaches involve developing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations in the present moment.</p>
          <p>This can help reduce the sense of being overwhelmed and support calmer responses to stress. Mindfulness is introduced gently and only when it feels appropriate. It is used as a practical tool rather than a formal practice.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="card">
          <h3>A person centred foundation</h3>
          <p>All counselling work is grounded in a person centred approach.</p>
          <p>This means sessions are respectful, collaborative, and non judgemental. There is no pressure to talk about anything before you are ready, and no expectation to have things worked out in advance.</p>
          <p>The aim is to provide a steady space where understanding can develop and change can unfold at a manageable pace.</p>
