        <details>
          <summary>What kinds of issues do you help with?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>People come for many reasons. Common themes include stress, anxiety, low mood, relationship difficulties, school related challenges, life transitions, and feeling stuck or overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>Some people arrive with a clear concern. Others know something is not working but are unsure how to name it. Both are a useful place to begin.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is in person counselling better than online?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>For many people, in person sessions feel easier and more grounding. Being in the same space can support focus and connection.</p>
            <p>That said, online counselling can also be effective, particularly when access or schedules make in person sessions difficult. The choice depends on what feels most supportive for you.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How long does counselling usually last?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>There is no fixed length.</p>
            <p>Some people come for a small number of sessions to work through a specific issue. Others choose to attend over a longer period, especially when concerns are more complex or long standing.</p>
            <p>The pace and duration are guided by what feels helpful and realistic.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What happens in a typical session?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Sessions are conversational and collaborative.</p>
            <p>Time is spent understanding what is happening for you, what you have already tried, and what you would like to be different. From there, the work focuses on practical steps, new perspectives, and ways of responding that feel more manageable.</p>
            <p>There is no requirement to talk about anything before you are ready.</p>
          </div>

            <p>Yes.</p>
