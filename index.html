            <p>People come for many reasons. Common themes include stress, anxiety, low mood, relationship difficulties, school related challenges, life transitions, and feeling stuck or overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>Some people arrive with a clear concern. Others know something is not working but are unsure how to name it. Both are a useful place to begin.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>For many people, in person sessions feel easier and more grounding. Being in the same space can support focus and connection.</p>
            <p>That said, online counselling can also be effective, particularly when access or schedules make in person sessions difficult. The choice depends on what feels most supportive for you.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>How long does counselling usually last?</span>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>There is no fixed length.</p>
            <p>Some people come for a small number of sessions to work through a specific issue. Others choose to attend over a longer period, especially when concerns are more complex or long standing.</p>
            <p>The pace and duration are guided by what feels helpful and realistic.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Sessions are conversational and collaborative.</p>
            <p>Time is spent understanding what is happening for you, what you have already tried, and what you would like to be different. From there, the work focuses on practical steps, new perspectives, and ways of responding that feel more manageable.</p>
            <p>There is no requirement to talk about anything before you are ready.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            <span>What does it mean to feel stuck?</span>
            <span class="faq-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Feeling stuck often shows up as going over the same thoughts or situations without knowing how to move forward. It can involve anxiety, frustration, withdrawal, or a sense of being on edge.</p>
            <p>Counselling helps identify what may be maintaining these patterns and supports small, realistic shifts that can create momentum over time.</p>

            <p>Yes.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Friends and family can be a valuable source of support. At times, though, those relationships are part of the situation or feel too close to allow for clear reflection.</p>
            <p>Counselling offers a neutral, confidential space to think things through without needing to protect or manage someone else's feelings.</p>
