        <h1 id="about-heading">About</h1>
        <p class="lead">Michael Multhaup is a Christchurch based counsellor working with adults, young people, and families in private practice.</p>
        <p>He brings a depth of experience shaped by more than a decade of work across counselling, education, and leadership roles. Over time, this work has involved supporting people through periods of stress, uncertainty, change, and growth, often in complex or high pressure situations.</p>
        <p>Michael holds a Master of Counselling with First Class Honours from the University of Canterbury, alongside postgraduate training in education and child protection. He is a fully registered member of the New Zealand Association of Counsellors and a registered teacher with Matatu Aotearoa.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="background-heading">Background and experience</h2>
        <p>Michael's professional background spans a range of settings, including educational, community, and clinical environments. This has included working with individuals, families, and wider support networks, often where multiple factors are at play.</p>
        <p>Through this work, he has developed a steady and thoughtful approach, particularly when people are feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or unsure how to move forward. Experience across different contexts has shaped an ability to hold complexity without rushing to solutions, while still remaining practical and focused on what is helpful.</p>

    <section class="section reveal" aria-labelledby="work-heading">
      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="work-heading">How he works</h2>
        <p>Michael offers a calm, respectful space where people can slow things down and make sense of what is happening.</p>
        <p>Counselling is collaborative rather than directive. Sessions focus on understanding patterns, strengthening coping, and identifying ways of responding that feel more manageable and aligned with what matters to the individual.</p>
        <p>The pace of the work is guided by the client. There is no pressure to talk about anything before it feels right, and no expectation to have things worked out in advance.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section reveal" aria-labelledby="approach-heading">
      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="approach-heading">Therapeutic approach</h2>
        <p>Michael works in a flexible way, drawing on a small number of well established counselling approaches. These may include cognitive behavioural therapy, solution focused counselling, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness based approaches.</p>
        <p>Methods are chosen based on usefulness rather than applied rigidly. All work is grounded in a person centred framework, which places emphasis on respect, empathy, and collaboration.</p>
        <p>This means the client's experience, values, and goals remain central throughout the work.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="gains-heading">What clients often hope to gain</h2>
        <p>People come to counselling for different reasons, and outcomes vary.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>a clearer understanding of what is happening for them</li>
          <li>practical tools to manage stress or emotional challenges</li>
          <li>greater confidence in decision making</li>
          <li>improved communication or relationships</li>
          <li>a sense of steadiness during periods of change</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For some, the work supports short term problem solving. For others, it offers a longer term space for reflection and growth. Both are welcomed.</p>

    <section class="section reveal" aria-labelledby="steady-heading">
      <div class="callout">
        <h2 id="steady-heading">A steady place to begin</h2>
        <p>Starting counselling does not require certainty or a clear plan.</p>
        <p>Michael aims to provide a steady and supportive environment where understanding can develop over time, and where people can leave sessions feeling more grounded, informed, and resourced to meet what lies ahead.</p>
